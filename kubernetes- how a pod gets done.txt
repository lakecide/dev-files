****KUBERNETES
(How does Kubernetes create a Pod)

We have the control node and the compute node. (The control node is the master plane where Kubernetes controller is located while the compute node is where containers are typically created.)
We have the Kube-api server which is the point of contact when a node is to be created via kubectl.
the api server stores values in the etcd (key value store which is also a source of truth for the kubernetes master)
**the scheduler always reaches out to the kube-api server typically every 5 sec to ensure there are no pods to be created because the scheduler is responsile for pods allocation to nodes.

**the compute node consist of the kubelet which is like the captain of the nodes , ** kubeproxy- which is responsible for node communications. **Container runtime engine: which is what is used to create a pod, eg docker.

**Once there is a pod to be created, the *scheduler tell the api server which node is to be used to create the pod and the kube-api server reaches out to the kubelet to create the pod
